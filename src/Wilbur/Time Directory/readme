Time Directory

All the files were sorted based on modification time. Clusters of 50 (or any other number) files were formed using this sorted list – files 1-50, 51-100 and so on. The modification time range of each of these groups of 50 files was found and folders were created with symlinks to these files. Time hierarchy was created above this. So the location of a file would be something like 2018/May/May_21_2018-May_30_2018/File1, where the folder  May_21_2018-May_30_2018 would contain 50 files. Similar to a) location hierarchy was also embedded into this. Example of a file path – 2018/May/May_21_2018-May_30_2018/Documents/Folder1/File1. There were also symlinks between folders of adjacent time ranges – for easy navigation. One point here was that the time range of files in a folder can be a measure of density, the longer the time range the lesser active the user was and vice versa. The shell implementation was very slow and I shifted to Python for all the later tasks. 

TimeDirectory.py
	Creates groups of files (fixed number) as folders based on last modification time
	Adjacent ranges of time group folders have symlinks between them
	Creates the folder 'time_root'

TimeDirectoryDeeperLocation.py
	Same as 'TimeDirectory.py' but creates the file location hierarchy below the time group folder.
	Eg - /time_root_deeper_location/Apr_9_2019-Apr_11_2019/FileSystemTest/VISA/Offline/imm5247e.pdf
	Creates the folder 'time_root_deeper_location'	

TimeDirectoryDeeperTime.py
	Same as 'TimeDirectory.py' but creates the time hierarchy above the time group folder.
	Eg - /time_root_deeper_time/2019/May/May 16 2019-May 18 2019/2009 Hierarchical File Systems Are Dead.pdf
	Creates the folder 'time_root_deeper_time'

TimeDirectoryDeeper.py
	Combination of 'TimeDirectoryDeeperTime.py' and 'TimeDirectoryDeeperLocation.py'
	Eg of path - /time_root_deeper/2019/Mar/Mar_12_2019-Mar_17_2019/COP/Traffic road sim/makefile
	Creates the folder 'time_root_deeper'
