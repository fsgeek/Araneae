# Hobo

The Hobo Spider is now found in the Pacific Northwest, but was introduced to the area (hence it is an invasive species) in
the 1980s.  It is a form of funnel web spider.

This _project_ is really about exploring possible ways of presenting information through the existing interface.  It's likely
to disappear and move on at some point.
